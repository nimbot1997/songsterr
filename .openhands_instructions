Remember that in case the previous command is still running - You CANNOT send new commands until the previous command is completed. 
By setting `is_input` to `true`, you can interact with the current process: (remember when trying to install dependencies, a user interaction might be needed).
You may wait longer to see additional output of the previous command by sending empty command '', send other commands to interact with the current process, or send keys ("C-c", "C-z", "C-d") to interrupt/kill the previous command before sending your new command.
